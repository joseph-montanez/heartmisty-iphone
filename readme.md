 	- 24 Tiles
 	- 120 Items
 	- 5 Characters
 	- 2 Songs

 	- Basic Map Controls
 	- Map Maker Interface Controls
 	- Save and Load Maps
 	- Save to Web
 - Game
 	- Design Hub
 	- Basic Dialog
 	- Attack System
 	- Basic NPC 
 	- Basic Monster AI
 	- Storyline (Hidden to not ruin the surpise for someone :] )
